title: Scrabble and an Internet Idol
---

Ze Frank was the first web show I ever watched, and in my view, it still sets the standard for what an internet show should be. When I originally planned to start my own blog, years ago, the idea was to try and do something like Ze did.

Unfortunately, I did nothing for several years, and then all that happened was this blog.

I am not from a Scrabble family, nor have I played much Scrabble in my life (until recently), but this episode of Ze's show I always found particularly funny.

So I started playing Scrabble (in the form of [Words With Friends for iPhone](http://newtoyinc.com)) with my friend Mike and in short order I had a game going with everyone I know with an iPhone. It is a remarkably addictive game to play, but much more interestingly, it has become a great way of keeping in touch.

You can chat within the app, but even if you aren't much of a chatter, nothing says "I acknowledge and assert our friendship" like a 91-point zinger.
