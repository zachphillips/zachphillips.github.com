> Even more encouragingly, we have a media that ensures that diverse views are heard; Chelsea Clinton previously worked at a $12 billion hedge fund and her former-Goldman-Sachs-banker husband earlier this year launched his own hedge fund with “two guys from Goldman,” so she brings a depth and diversity of perspetive that is sorely lacking in our news (true, CNN boldly features the former Goldman Sachs employee and current finacé of Citigroup executive, Erin Burnett, but nothing can compete with Chelsea Clinton’s rich, impressive journalism background).
