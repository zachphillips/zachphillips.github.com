title: Rolling Your R's
---

Here at zach.be, it isn't all fun and games; We also aspire to help people achieve their goals and dreams. Sometimes in life, you run into roadblocks that seem impossible to get around. This can be very disheartening. At zach.be, we're here to remind you that there is _always _a solution.

I am going to describe one such obstacle that almost took me down for the count when I was thirteen years old. Lucky enough for me, the solution came just when I needed it: Right before I began my first Spanish class, in seventh grade. And it came from a very unexpected place.

My whole childhood, I wanted to be able to roll my R's, and I couldn't. I wanted to because everyone else could. I wanted to because I had a passing interest in speaking other languages. I wanted to mostly because other guys could make cooler machine-gun noises than I could (this was probably my greatest motivation).

I asked for advice from everyone I could find. I tried and tried to understand this concept, change the position of my tongue, this way, that way, for years. It was all in vain.

Weary and bedraggled, I had almost given up all hope. I would be that lame guy who can't roll his R's, for the rest of my life. What kind of life would that be?

Then suddenly, one day, just like that, the solution presented itself.

I was randomly watching bloopers of _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_, and there was a scene in which Carlton could not get a certain line out without making an R-rolling sound and then laughing hysterically. This line would change my life. It is the key to the broken tongue that can't roll:

"But it'll cut into my treat-or-treating time."

Looks innocuous at first, but this statement has great power to change your life. If you want to learn to roll your R's, here is the step-by-step solution (which I have already used to fix myself and at least ten other people):



	
  1. When alone, driving, or otherwise away from the judgments of others, repeat the line "But it'll cut into my trick-or-treating time."

	
  2. Say it louder and faster. Louder and faster. Do this for many minutes at a time. Sometimes, the remarkable moment comes almost at once. Sometimes it takes a while.

	
  3. Once you feel the magic of your tongue rolling, even just a little, you can begin to shorten the phrase, eventually down to just "But it'll—"

	
  4. You are now rolling your R's! Don't be concerned if it seems that you can only roll the R when immediately preceded by a consonant B. This is normal.

	
  5. Keep playing with the new sound, and over time, your tongue will relax more and more, and you will be able to drop the B, and add any sound you want, or none at all.

	
  6. You are now a pro. Go forth and learn Spanish, Italian, Russian, or all three!


And that's it. It sounds silly, but it works. Please pass this along to anyone you feel is in need. Take it from someone who couldn't roll his R's: Life is much better with the rolling R than without.

Here is the video that changed my life. The first few seconds are all that matters:
