title: Wordpress Linked List Plug-in by YJ Soon

**Update: I have since moved this site over to Jekyll and am no longer using this plugin. If you are using Wordpress, my feelings here still apply. I need to post soon about how I've gotten this behavior working in Jekyll.**

I wanted my (dusty, decaying) blog to behave more like [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net)'s, where I could link to things and comment on them easily. Until now, I've just been using facebook for this. My loathing for facebook and the desire to have a place of my own led to me finally getting around to making the [zach.be](http://zach.be/) blog functional.

I ended up finding this (awesome) guy named [yjsoon](http://yjsoon.com/) (who lives in Singapore and is apparently good at everything) who made a Wordpress plug-in that causes your RSS for linked-list posts to work correctly.

I did find out, though, that the theme I installed so long ago, which seemed like a good idea at the time, is actually pretty lame, and created by a bit of a, how do you say, [jack-ass](http://twitter.com/#!/pearsonified)? (Example: He thinks America's criminal justice system is [too soft](http://twitter.com/#!/pearsonified/status/19839293144956928). With the highest rate of incarceration in the world, etc., etc..)

And he's an all-around tool which comes across in his Twitter handle.

I'm just mad he has my money.

Anyway, I didn't want to go through and re-implement everything in a new theme or new CMS, but for the life of me, I could not get the headlines to link correctly, though the RSS worked perfectly just as advertised on yjsoon's site. So I sent yjsoon an email and asked what I should do.

>"Hey buddy, you don't know me, but you made me a free thing and now I am asking you to help me fix the free thing you made for me because it doesn't work because I did something stupid four years ago when I started this blog I haven't posted on."

Long story medium-length: He fixed Thesis for me, made it work for a linked-list, and I love the internet because of people like yjsoon. So... If you need to fix Thesis to work like a linked list, just send me an email and I will help you make that a reality.

Unwritten rule of Internet kindness: Pay it forward.
