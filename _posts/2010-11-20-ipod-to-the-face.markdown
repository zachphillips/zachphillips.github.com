title: iPod to the Face!
---

We shot a short film in Central Park this summer (working title: Benny's Blues), and in the first hour of shooting we had a significant problem to solve.

The inciting incident of the film required a jogger to accidentally catch her hand in her iPod headphones, flinging her monstrous 2nd generation iPod through the air, whereupon this iPod would need to hit a street performer in the face.

Seems like there should be a simple solution to this, but it actually presents a lot of problems:

1. We can't actually hit the actor in the face with an iPod, as that would hurt just as much as it's depicted to hurt.

2. Creating a foam iPod is a pain in the ass and won't necessarily have a natural feel when it clatters to the ground.

3. Doing the old "basketball trick" with cinematography (throw the iPod in shot A, accurately hit the actor in the face in shot B) has the potential to be really cheesy, and won't achieve the spontaneity or believability we want.

4. Even if we wanted to shoot a "forreal" version of this, the chances of the actor accurately hitting her co-star in the face 1 out of 100 times, is, well, not good. And we need several successful takes to choose from.

So someone had the simple, ingenious idea to just pantomime the action and shoot the iPod later. I was so busy trying to come up with a fancy way to achieve this that I forgot about a simple green-screen composite (or chroma key), which is something I've done a hundred times before.

However, as simple as the concept of chroma-keying is, I find when I told people I would just shoot the iPod later and then put it in this shot, I was met with blank stares and "Whatever you say"s and "I don't know how you are going to do that, but okay"s.

So I thought I may as well put up a quick screencast to describe how this is done:

>This is not a tutorial. If you want to learn how to do a simple chroma key composite, there are a million resources out there for you. This video is intended only to help people understand what this is, and how simple it can be when you have the right tools.
