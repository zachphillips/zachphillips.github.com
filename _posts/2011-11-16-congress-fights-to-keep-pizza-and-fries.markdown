I remember that when I was in high school and there were two choices of lines.

1. The lunch lines, which offered arguably balanced meals (plural)
2. The french fry line (singular)

The french fry line was always really long, and the lunch lines were generally empty, except on certain days. Lunch cost 65 cents, I believe, and the fries cost $1.25.

The vast majority of us ate french fries for lunch. They even put out hot sauce for us.

> "This agreement ensures that nutrient-rich vegetables such as potatoes, corn and peas will remain part of a balanced, healthy diet in federally funded school meals and recognizes the significant amounts of potassium, fiber and vitamins A and C provided by tomato paste, ensuring that students may continue to enjoy healthy meals such as pizza and pasta," said Kraig Naasz, president of the American Frozen Food Institute.

I wonder if guys like Kraig go home thinking about how much they are caricatures of themselves from Kafka and Orwell novels.
