title: Major Flaw in iOS Keyboard "Shortcuts"
---

Though it's awesome that Apple has created the ability to enable some universal custom auto-completion in iOS, it's implemented in a very poor and arbitrary way.

You have to tap a trailing space in order for iOS to spit out your snippet, and the trailing space is left there. You then either have to delete it or just leave it (as a regular computer user, "invisible" space characters are not invisible to me. I know what they can do and they make me very uneasy).

The sad part about this is that it shows a continued lack of trust in regular folks' ability to use software that is _actually as efficient as possible_.

TextExpander and every implementation of keyboard macros (ever) has gotten this function right, but Apple feels it has to leave a place for "Are you sure?" at the end, when any user who knows how to find the shortcuts in the settings should be given the benefit of the doubt that they're probably smart enough to choose a trigger that wouldn't be found anywhere in their usual typing.

And the worst part is when you answer "Are you sure?" with "Yes," it still has to leave you with a useless empty little space.

Sometimes, trying to be user-friendly winds up being very unfriendly.
