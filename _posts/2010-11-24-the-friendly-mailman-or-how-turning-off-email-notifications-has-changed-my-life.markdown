title: The Friendly Mailman or How Turning Off Email Notifications has Changed My Life
---

> Note: I am writing this post in a WiFi enabled airplane, and hopefully finishing in time to post it. UPDATE: Just as I was about to post, a voice came over the intercom to tell me to arbitrarily return my tray-table to the upright position and put away my toys and crayons and sit up straight and stop talking to my neighbor... Oh well. Next time.

Believe me, it's the last thing I ever thought I would (or could) do.

But I did it. And it has been a mini-revolution in my life. I have a newfound sense of freedom I didn't know I was missing. Let me explain.

Email is supposed to be just that, electronic _mail_. Over the last ten years or so, it has morphed into something very different.

Imagine: You are sitting at your desk, Working on something Important (you do Work on Important Things, right?), and the doorbell rings.

"My, who could that be?" you think to yourself. You get up from your desk and walk through the living room to the front hallway, kicking your kid's pile of shoes out of the way, and you open the door.

It's the mailman. "Hello, Ma'am, I have a letter for you. It's such a nice day out and my load is so light, I thought I'd hand-deliver it right to you."

"Oh, isn't that nice of you! Thanks so much!"

"Well, you have yourself a good one, ma'am," and he walks away.

"Thanks again!" You close the door and open the letter. It's from your cousin Terry, who you like, and he has written about a number of things he's planning on doing for the holidays. At the end of the letter, he writes a troubling and time-sensitive line:

> Can't wait for our annual New Years poker game!

But you'll be in Florida for New Years. You need to tell Terry as soon as possible. Arriving back at your desk, you have a seat, and the doorbell rings again.

"My my, a busy day," you think as you get up to go answer the door again.

You open the door, and it's the friendly mailman again. "Howdy there again, ma'am, I have another letter for you. Must have missed it on my way by. It's a good thing I have such a light load today."

"Oh, why thank you." You glance at the letter, and notice it is from your credit card company, and this upsets you because you were out of debt with them, about to cut the card, and then you foolishly bought your ticket to Boca Raton with it, because you could get "double miles." Of course, you didn't pay it back. Something came up.

"Say, ma'am?" The mailman is still standing in the doorway. "You don't have any letters you need to send, do you? On account of how nice it is, I don't mind waiting if you need to get anything together that you want me to take with me on my way back to the post office."

"Ummm."

"Really, it ain't no trouble. I'm just enjoying the outdoors."

*Terry.* "Okay, hold on." You scrawl out a note, and you feel obligated to tell Terry about what your kid's been doing because he always sends you all of his kids' stuff and they're always doing all these amazing things and what if Terry thinks your kid is kind of a loser and maybe if you were as involved as Terry in your kid's life but no that's smotheringâ€”

You rewrite the note a couple of times, check it for spelling errors, and then stuff it in an envelope and hand it to the mailman, who seems to be semi-audibly humming *Zip-a-dee-doo-da.*

"Well, you have just a wonderful day ma'am. Great day to be alive." He walks away, whistling.

"Thanks, you've been so sweet," you call after him.

Okay, back to work. You toss the credit card statement in The Basket and walk back to your desk. But maybe you want another Diet Coke. Yes, you do. You go get a Diet Coke and then finally make it back to your Important Work. After forty-five or forty-eight seconds and a nice yawn, your fingers start moving over the keys again, and you're back to work.

Ring-a-ding-a-ding-dong!

It's the mailman.

Would you put up with this?

**Hell no you wouldn't.**

So turn off your email notifications.

And goddamnit, turn off Call Waiting! (Super-Advanced, I know. More on that later...)
