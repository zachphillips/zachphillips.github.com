**The greatest thing about the age we live in today is the fact that you don't necessarily need to _know_ anything. The key to navigating and surviving the information jungle is to know _how and where to find exactly what you need_.**

**No need to reinvent the wheel or to rewrite a book there are already five good versions of.**

**In Allies, Mentors, Heralds, and Mavens, I will tell you about some of the sources where I get my information. These are people who have proven to me time and again to be elegant and thorough in their unrelenting search for what we all want: The best of everything.**

I am what you might refer to as a software addict. I love finding new and useful applications to help me with all areas of my life and workflow. I take this obsession to the extreme, as is my tendency, and I often spend hours and days and weeks trialing different software and finding ways to get it into my workflow. Ironically, I am usually doing this at the expense of progress on any of my actual _work_.

I thought for certain that there could be no one as ridiculous as I was about this stuff, until I found [the Creativityist](http://creativityist.com). Behind this exceptional blog is a designer/pastor from Austin, Texas named John Chandler.

The focus of the blog is on cultivating and realizing the artist within yourself, through any number of spiritual, technological, or softwarical means.

Whenever I have a question about workflow, the Creativityist is where I find my answer. Probably half of the applications on my dock were suggested by John (not to mention the framework for zach.be!).

If you are interested in improving your relationship to your Mac, and in finding software solutions to make your creative life simpler and more engaging, whether you're a designer, writer, filmmaker, web developer, or just need some inspiration for practicing creativity, the Creativityist has already done most of the work for you.

If my scribblings could ever be half as useful to someone else as John's have been to me, I will consider zach.be a wild success.
