Rachel Andrew:

> WYSIWYG Editors suck because they promote thinking about style rather than content. While content editors are busy changing headings to Comic Sans, pondering the use of a grimacing smiley on their about us page or getting creative with colour, they are not considering the actual copy they are adding to the site.

The CMS axiom: When there are 999 ways to make something look right, a non-designer will usually find the one way to make it look wrong.

It's not a knock on them, because it's not their fault, because it's not their job.
