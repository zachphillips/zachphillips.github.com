This looks like a nice app for navigating mass transit. You can be fairly certain a product is good when [@sandwichvideo](https://twitter.com/#!/sandwichvideo) gets involved. Adam Lisagor ([@lonelysandwich](https://twitter.com/#!/lonelysandwich)) gets a _lot_ of enquiries and so when he accepts a video project, it can be safely regarded as a stamp of approval from a trusted source. 

The video usually turns out pretty good too. He likes to show the viewer exactly how a product will be useful to them.

There's one little shot at the end that I did (the Washington, DC one). Many thanks to my friend Barrett Starling for coming out in his Sunday best on short notice.
