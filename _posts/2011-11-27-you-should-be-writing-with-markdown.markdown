> Markdown nerds, this is not for you. This is for regular folks who need to start using Markdown. Go away.

Did you ever make a little smiley face with a colon and a close-parenthesis? Was this incredibly difficult for you to do? No? Then you, my friend, have no excuse to not be writing in Markdown. Get rid of Microsoft Word, open up a plain-text editor and start writing something that will be forward-compatible, exchangeable, and beautiful in its simple elegance.

I repeat: It is exactly as hard to write Markdown as it is to make a sad-face.

	Here's a paragraph.

	Here's another paragraph. See, all I did was leave a line in between.

	##Here's a Level Two heading. Just a couple of pound signs.

## And this is what a Level Two heading looks like (in this context)

	###Here's a Level Three heading. Just add another pound.

### And this is what _it_ looks like

You can have as many levels of heading as you want, but don't be a terrible person with more than six. Seriously.

What is a heading level, exactly? Well, it's something that you can elect to style in any way you want, but generally you would make it bigger than say, your paragraph text. You can use a level one heading to hold your title, for example, and a level two to label sections, and a level four for something else. Whatever you want. The point of all this is that you can decide what these headings will look like in different contexts, and you get to set their style once, and it will be repeated throughout whatever you have written. If you've ever tried to go through a Microsoft Word document and make it "look right," you should begin to see how much better it is to write with Markdown.

Oh _snap_, do you see these _italics_?

	_This is how you do italics_.

Just an underscore on each side. Or if you would prefer to use an asterisk, **that's fine too**.

	**This is bold, by the way**.

Again, you can use underscores if you want. Underscores and asterisks are interchangeable when it comes to bold and italics. But hold up! It's not even really bold and italics we're talking about and here's an opportunity to try to give you a small peek into how you can think about Markdown and how it works differently from what you're used to:

In Markdown, when you surround a word or a string of words with single underscores, you are telling Markdown that this part of your text is to be _emphasized_. Generally, you emphasize your text by making the font-style italic, as you are used to doing in Microsoft Word. But what if, for a certain application of the piece you're writing, you wanted emphasized text to be not italic, but slightly larger and purple? Because you have sytactically indicated all of your emphasized text using underscores in Markdown, all you have to do is change the style applied to emphasized text, whether you are outputting to a PDF for printing, the web, or wherever your piece is headed. Now, everywhere you have emphasized text, it will be automatically styled to your wishes.

And in a hundred years, when the way they are emphasizing text is by making it holographic shimmering rainbow ether, the piece you wrote in Markdown will still work fine.

Do you see? Do you?

A couple more rules:

	1. Here's how you make an ordered list.
	2. That's right. Most obvious thing in the world.
	3. Just numbers, periods, and then stuff.

	* And here's an unordered (bulleted) list.
	+ You can use asterisks, pluses, or hyphens.
	- Just don't forget to put a space between the bullet and the liste item.

1. Here's how an ordered list looks.
2. Just as you'd expect.

* And here's the unordered list.
+ There's a lot you can do with this.

So how can you get started? Download a simple plain-text editor. Two that come with built-in Markdown support are [_Byword_](http://bywordapp.com/) and [_iA Writer_](http://www.iawriter.com/). But don't misunderstand me. The "support" I'm referring to is purely cosmetic. _All_ plain text editors "support Markdown." _Byword_ and _Writer_ are just a little prettier. If you want, you can totally just used TextEdit, pre-installed as part of OS X. Just make sure you are saving everything as .txt and not .rtf.

Last but not least. Links. Those things which make the internet so much more powerful than the printed page.

    This is a link to [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/). That's it. 
    Just put the text of the link in square brackets, 
    and the URL in parentheses.

And out pops a link to [the Byword site](http://bywordapp.com/).

There is a lot more that Markdown can do, but I've covered most of what you'll use.

In closing, I will say that one of the nicest things about Markdown is simply the act of writing in a plain text editor. It is so easy, so clean, and so fast. Anything that reduces the friction between you and your writing is well worth it, and with Markdown, I think you'll find that writing feels much more like gliding than grinding
