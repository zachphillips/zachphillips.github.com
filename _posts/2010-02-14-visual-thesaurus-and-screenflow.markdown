title: Visual Thesaurus and ScreenFlow
---



I am not a guy who uses a thesaurus much. I don't have a very large vocabulary, but I try to make use of the words that I do know.

This might all change. The [Visual Thesaurus](http://visualthesaurus.com) is likely the coolest thesaurus ever. I used it last night when trying to come up with a clever name for something. I think it's an interesting tool for brainstorming. It is basically a word-association engine, but the design is so nifty, you have to play with it...

I created the little screencast of it above using [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm), a great screencapture suite from Telestream. The amount of features in ScreenFlow make it so simple to do elegant screencasts, that even an anal-retentive video editor like myself didn't have to take it outside ScreenFlow into Final Cut or After Effects.

Of all the screencasting software I've used, ScreenFlow is definitely the simplest, most robust, and well-designed.
