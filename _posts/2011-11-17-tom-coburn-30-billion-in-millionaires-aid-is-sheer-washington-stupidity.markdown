title: 'â˜… Tom Coburn: $30 Billion In Millionaires Aid Is ''Sheer Washington Stupidity'''

Tom Coburn, the Republican Senator from Oklahoma:

> "From tax write-offs for gambling losses, vacation homes, and luxury yachts to subsidies for their ranches and estates, the government is subsidizing the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Multimillionaires are even receiving government checks for not working. This welfare for the well-off -- costing billions of dollars a year -- is being paid for with the taxes of the less fortunate."

Two possibilities:

1. Coburn really is a principled conservative
2. He's actually been reading the [polls](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/poll-shows-most-see-deepening-wealth-gap/2011/11/08/gIQAecJs3M_story.html) lately
