I've been alive now for more than twenty-seven years, and other than one accusatory line from Wallace Shawn in _The Princess Bride_ and a few brief mentions when trying to label everything on a North American map as a third-grader (I was a smart-ass), I have not heard the Nation of Greenland mentioned once. They are the world's largest island (true fact), our North American neighbors—and I think they might be hiding from us.

I've never met anyone from Greenland, or anyone who has been to Greenland.

I would venture to say that I've never met anyone who has ever met anyone who has possibly ever met anyone who is from Greenland, or has been to Greenland. I have never heard of anyone who has heard of anyone else ever hearing something about Greenland.

I used to believe in the Six Degrees of Separation theory, but I'm beginning to think that Greenland might be the exception to the rule.

Think about any other sovereign nation in the world, and I challenge you to find one you've heard less about. Malta is Malta. Grenada is Grenada. We all know about Luxembourg, and Swaziland is cool as that little weird country in the middle of South Africa. They pop up in the news every once in a while. You don't hear much from Laos, but there is a Laotian restaurant in Syracuse, New York, for God's sake.

What the hell is going on in Greenland?

Well, apparently, there are a lot of Inuit people living along fjords there. They speak Greenlandic (no joke), and they catch a good amount of shrimp. There are no roads because of all the fjords, and people use planes to fly around. They still respect the Danish crown, though they are independent of Denmark.

And it's super-beautiful.

Greenland, what are you hiding? I've got my eye on you...
