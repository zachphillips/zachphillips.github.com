My grandfather [died this fall](http://zach.be/2011/10/truman-toland-1922-2011/). He was 89.

Though he was an exceptional artist, he mostly kept his work to himself. *You can see some of his sketches [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zphillips/sets/72157594484947180/) and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zphillips/sets/72157594395725652/).*

While emptying out his Cincinnati home, my parents found a collection of Christmas cards that he had made, one each year, from 1948 to 2008.

I think they say a lot about the years he drew them. I also think they're pretty cool.

Always a tinkerer, he was part of the first wave of artists to use computers (Amigas, in his case) for drawing.

Here are some highlights. Follow [this link](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zphillips/sets/72157628554415845/) to see them all.

Enjoy. And Merry Christmas.

###1952

This was the year Uncle Robert was born. His birth weight slickly noted on the card.
