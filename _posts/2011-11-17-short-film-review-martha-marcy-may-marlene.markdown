Elizabeth Olsen (the younger sister of the Olsen Twins) _definitely_ deserves an Oscar nod for this role. She was Oscar-good. Completely blew me away. This is just the beginning for her.

This is one of the more powerful films that I've seen in a long time, with tension I've only seen matched by Lars von Trier.

The dialogue is incredibly true-to-life. Characters talk the way people really talk. The cinematography is so deliberate and masterful, leaving the viewer feeling trapped in the frame, and often agonizing over what might be just outside of it.

All praise aside, I never want to see this fucking movie again, and I'd also like for these disturbing thoughts to go away.

Trailers can ruin movies for me, so I tend to avoid them, but if you're not like me, go ahead and [check it out](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/marthamarcymaymarlene/).

Incredible feature debut for Sean Durkin. I'm in awe.
