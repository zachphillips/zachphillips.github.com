> I’m a bit sad for Firefox. It used to be the fast, powerful, progressive browser that finally broke IE’s era of stagnant dominance and saved web developers’ sanity. Now, it’s a bloated, slow, unstable monster that’s often a pain in this web developer’s ass.

My feelings exactly. I never thought I'd see the day when I was cursing at Firefox for bad rendering, but here we are. And is it just me, or does all type look worse in Firefox? It's as though every typeface is semibold and jaggy.

As much as I think competition is a good thing, I really long for a WebKit-only browser landscape.
