Okay, so there have been quite a few articles and premature reviews on the iPad, and (though I have not done a formal count) it appears that most of them are claiming that somehow this is a big letdown: "It's just a big iPod Touch..."

What these commenters are failing to understand (and all that really matters about this device) is that: "Holy &@%#, it's a big iPod Touch!"

The world has never seen a ten-inch multi-touch surface.

The iPhone was absolutely revolutionary, as everyone knows, but it really only gave us a little tease, a preview of how we would be interacting with our technology in the near future. The iPad will be the first time we _really _get to see multi-touch in action. And there is no way to overhype that.

The failure of all the haters is that they have not used their imaginations to discover what could be implied by a surface on which one can use all of her fingers simultaneously, and what that might do for the human—technology relationship.

I'm sure there were those who said they overhyped the wheel. "Bah! Wheels! Who needs that..."
