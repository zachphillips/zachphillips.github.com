title: Exposure of a Terrible NCAA Basketball Rule
---

Tonight, the Syracuse Orangemen beat the Connecticut Huskies in a game that came down to the wire, and was ultimately tainted.

I am a die-hard Orangemen fan, and am always glad to come out with a victory, but I also have to keep it real about this game. I think it was Voltaire who was quoted as saying "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." This very important quote to me has a very weak stretch of a connection to what happened tonight, but basically: "I disapprove of UConn beating Syracuse, but I will defend to the death their right to win."

Totally weak, but I'm tired, so forgive me. Here's the truth:

UConn was robbed on an egregious abuse of a terrible NCAA rule.

Syracuse had the ball with the game tied and 40 seconds left. Andy Rautins rushed and badly missed a three, presumably in order to ensure that Syracuse would have the ball for the last shot. Luckily, Syracuse got the rebound, and could now hold for the final shot. Suddenly, on a nucklehead play, Scoop Jardine decided to rush down the lane and force a bad circus layup. This was a terrible error in judgment, and there is no excuse for it. He missed the layup, and UConn corralled the rebound and would now have a chance for the final shot to win.

_Oops, pumpfake! Actually, Syracuse gets the ball back and another try. Mulligan! Silly Scoop Jardine! We'll give you another crack at it!_

What could possibly justify this?

Well, a few years ago, the NCAA willfully and thoughtlessly decided to institute a new rule that coaches are allowed to request time-outs. This is complete bullshit on every possible level, and clearly just the Coaches' Lobby getting their way.

Jim Boeheim called a time-out, literally_ while Scoop was in the air taking a shot_. He tapped on the official's shoulder. "Gee, Russell, that boy's outta control over there! Better call a time-out before he lets go of the ball..."

Coaches are not playing the game. They should not be allowed to have _any_ effect on the actual gameplay. They are there to _coach. _This was a glaring exposure of an unconscionably stupid rule instituted by the pathetically incompetent people who run the National Collegiate Athletics Association.

They should be ashamed of themselves.

Syracuse very well may have won this game either way, but we'll never know now, will we? I love a victory, but a tainted one leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth.

For any of you who think "It's just a game. Calm down, psycho...": A post for you will be forthcoming.
