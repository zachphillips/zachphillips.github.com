> The NPD Group just released their latest numbers. The number one selling smartphone last quarter was the iPhone 4. The over-a-year-old phone which Consumer Reports refused to endorse over a year ago, remember. Meanwhile, the number two phone for the quarter? The two-year-old iPhone 3GS. Does anyone really think that the LG Thrill is going to outsell the iPhone 4S this quarter? What about the Motorola Droid Bionic? Maybe the Samsung Galaxy S II?

> Consumer Reports now matters just as much as specs do. Which is to say, not at all.

When you read Consumer Reports, you just get the sense that your aunts and uncles and grandparents work there. Which is nothing against aunts and uncles and grandparents, but they still can't figure out how to hook up the cable box. I think it's time the folks at Consumer Reports started collecting Social Security. Just kick back and widdle some.

Astute reporting from the only good person at god-awful TechCrunch.
