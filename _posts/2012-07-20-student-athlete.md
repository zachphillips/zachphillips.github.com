title: Rethinking the Student-Athlete
---

For its financial stakeholders, the NCAA is doing just fine. Big profits, endorsements, TV contracts. But for the student-athletes, the fans, and the quality of the entertainment, the NCAA is not fine. It's broken, and getting worse. Conference realignment, corruption, conflicts of interest, student-athletes getting in big trouble for seemingly minor infractions while others get away with murder, *still no playoff in football?!?!?!* (no, a four team invitational is not a playoff, shut up), the list goes on.

I have a proposal that I think could make college athletics a little bit better, by making the transaction, between all parties, a bit more honest.

So I will cut right to the chase and pose the question: Why couldn't a stellar basketball player, one of the top players in the world at his age, decide to major in Basketball? Why shouldn't he get credit for daily three-hour practices, have a class schedule built around all of the travel he'll be doing, taking core classes on the History of Basketball, the Footwork of Michael Jordan, or the Zone Defense? 

The most obvious reason on the surface is that we don't think of sports as the artforms that they are, possibly the most celebrated in the world.

Today, I am proposing a new accredited degree: **Bachelor of Sports Arts in Basketball** (gotta start somewhere)

I was a Film-Drama major in college. One of my sister's dual majors was Modern Dance. Sounds normal, if ill-advised, doesn't it? It isn't Psychology or Finance, but I doubt you'd find a lot of people who would question the validity of a major in Film.

Film is a big business. The second largest contributor to the economy of the State of California, which is the richest in the Union (California's #1 industry is agriculture, if you were wondering). There are hundreds of thousands of Los Angelans making real money telling stories on a two-dimensional screen. And then there are the folks like me, who aren't part of Hollywood, but work in small video production houses in every town and city in the country, making commercials and web videos for clients. And then there are my friends who majored in Cello and Trumpet. We're all doing okay, even if none of us are directing $100 million feature films or playing in the New York Philharmonic.

The most important thing to note is that our college years were spent pursuing exactly what we were interested in, and because of this, college was a unique and valuable experience in our lives, and led, at least indirectly, to the careers we are working in today.

If you're a 17-year-old with interest, talent, and promise in filmmaking, there are options for you. If you're into Surface Pattern Design, you can get a Masters in that. But if you are the greatest basketball player ever to come out of the state of Kentucky whose lifelong dream is to play in the NBA, you can pick a major that has nothing to do with your chosen career, doesn't take into account that you are *doubly* as busy as every other student, and oh yeah, then there's a 12-inch book of special rules for you, about who's allowed to buy you lunch or talk to you or *tweet* at you.

> This one time when I was a sophomore, Steven Spielberg contacted me about directing a film he was producing, but then Turner Classic Movies found out about the call and I was suspended from all filmmaking activities for two years and it was a big mess. What really sucked was that I had to remain in good academic standing with my Pre-Dental degree, but you know, I was on scholarship for *Film*, so...

Think about that for a second... "All I want to do is play basketball." "Too bad. You have to do this other crap." Imagine if someone said that to your chemistry-wiz daughter, or your piano virtuoso brother. How dismissive that would be. What a distraction. What a waste of their time and money.

**Okay Zach, every Division I player thinks he's going to make an NBA squad, but only a handful of them do. What about the others?** Like Film, Basketball is big business. Just because you don't care about or respect a certain industry doesn't mean the market hasn't carved out a giant space for it. A lot of former college players make very decent livings in other leagues around the world. They can go into coaching, physical education, the myriad of businesses related to sports, or maybe they start their own businesses not directly related to basketball. Or they go on like most of today's graduates and pursue further education in another field altogether.

In addition to directing and editing videos, in the last few years I've suddenly found myself designing and developing web applications and even physical objects, and getting paid good money for it. You may not think this is related to film, but everything I've done has jumped off of something else and you can trace it all back to the craft of storytelling and the skills and tools I've picked up while pursuing that.

Playing basketball on the Division I stage involves a level of work ethic and talent that few can claim. If you were reading a resumé, which would impress you more: Four years of starting for the Kentucky Wildcats or a Bachelor's in Child and Family Studies? Which would convey more confidence, drive, and talent?

So let's quit this dumb charade. Dion Waiters came to Syracuse University to play basketball, and to showcase his talents for the NBA. After making a huge improvement as a sophomore, his option was to leave and (possibly) make millions while focusing solely on his passion, or to take the bus from South Campus to Technical Writing 205 in the snow. Now, Waiters's situation is different from a lot of guys who opt to leave early these days, as he wound up being a high lottery pick, but have you ever heard of an easier decision in your life?

So what if the choice were different? What if he were given the option of spending another year focusing 100% of his energy on basketball, moving further along in the work he's been doing with his coaches that has yielded such great results, becoming (probably) an even more certain lottery pick next year (and meanwhile have another shot at the NCAA title, because you know, gamers wanna win)? I'm not saying Waiters would take it, and I'm not going to speculate on whether or not that would be a good idea for him, but I will say for damned certain that the biggest possible waste of his time would be to work on his Speech Communication degree.

I've been thinking about this idea for about ten years now and only just got it down thanks to some pressure from Sean Keeley at *Troy Nunes is an Absolute Magician*. I'm interested to hear anyone's thoughts, especially those of you in positions to move this idea forward to where it is an offered degree (at such a school where it would be attractive to *candidates*, because we don't need to call them recruits anymore, see?).

Everyone wins. Great players get to go to school without stupid pretenses and can still proudly call themselves scholar-athletes. Coaches officially become the Professors of the game that they have always been. And fans might get to watch a few guys play for a few more years. Overall, the world of college basketball would be a more honest place. And eventually, Basketball can be a major every bit as respectable as Comparative Literature (my fianceé's major... she's a lawyer now).

And Dion, if you're really into Modern Dance, you can dual-major like my sister did. No problem.

> This is a good first step. We can go on to the far more politically impossible improvements like the rules and the money another day.
