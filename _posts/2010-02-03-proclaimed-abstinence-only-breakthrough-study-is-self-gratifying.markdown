title: Abstinence-Only (Breakthrough!) Study is Self-Gratifying
---

I was surprised when perusing the Huffington Post today to discover [an article lauding abstinence-only education](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/01/AR2010020102628.html?hpid=topnews), claiming that there was a totally new and totally awesome scientific study which claimed that abstinence-only education irrefutably worked!

How odd, I thought, because a) the Huffington Post usually does not publish articles that run counter to certain agendas (the comprehensive-sex-ed agenda being one such untouchable darling), and b) it simply isn't true, and has never been true. So I thought I'd better look at the article to find out just what in hell they take me for...

I was then disappointed to discover that many other semi-trusted news sources had also picked up the story, including NPR. I was further disappointed when none of them did their jobs as journalists, to point out the obvious spin being thrown in the very premise of this study:

Rob Stein, _The Washington Post_:

> Sex education classes that focus on encouraging children to remain abstinent can persuade a significant proportion to delay sexual activity, researchers reported Monday in a landmark [study](http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/164/2/152?home) that could have major implications for U.S. efforts to protect young people against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.

> Only about a third of sixth- and seventh-graders who completed an abstinence-focused program started having sex within the next two years, researchers found. Nearly half of the students who attended other classes, including ones that combined information about abstinence and contraception, became sexually active.

> The findings are the first clear evidence that an abstinence program could work.

Okay, so I'm going to step right over all of the initial shadiness about the study (why 12 and 13-year-olds?, what does _abstinence-focused _mean?, apparently this was a totally new technique with new role-playing games?, condoms weren't disparaged?, why was this study on black children only?) and I'll just hand them totally reasonable, scientific, slam-dunk answers to all these questions. Still, we're left with one glaring flaw: What is the point of sex-education?

Is it to "delay" kids from having sex by up to two years? Is it to "delay" them having sex at all? Well, the abstinence-only people sure think so, and when you frame your articles this way, _WashingtonHuffingtonABCNPR_, you play right into their talking points! How convenient! What headlines!

My understanding is that the purpose of sex education is not to control and suppress sex expression, as it was in the past, but to offer information on the risks associated with sex, and safety measures that should be taken when having sex, and in a more perfect world, to indicate the possibilities for experience and fulfillment that sexuality offers if one approaches it in an honest, mature, and thoughtful manner.

So why is sex a public health problem, and why do our kids need to have sex education? Is it because people are starting when they're twelve instead of fourteen? Or could it be because people are getting pregnant and contracting sexual-transmitted diseases...?

What the hell does this study say about unwanted pregnancy and disease? Nothing.

Studies have shown over and over again that abstinence-only education has a _[devastating](http://ari.ucsf.edu/science/reports/abstinence.pdf)_ effect on teen pregnancy and STDs when compared with comprehensive sex education. This is why all funding for abstinence-only education programs has finally been righteously cut.

Now, the moralizing Bible-interpreters that have been trying to commandeer our educational system to spread the reinterpreted, rerevealed word of their skygod have been emboldened, and will likely once again creep into our health classes and tell our children not to have sex because it's evil and wrong, and much pregnancy and rampant disease will ensue. Thanks.

Do your job at least once in a while, would you?
