James Kwak from _The Atlantic_:

> The Cain 9-9-9 plan is breathtaking. The poorest Americans would see their effective tax rate increase from about 5 percent to 18 percent. The typical household would pay $4,000 more than today. But the top 0.1 percent would get an average tax cut of $1.4 million and would pay an effective tax rate of 18 percentâ€”lower than any other income group. That a plan so insane could be proposed by a leading presidential candidate just shows how crazy our political system has become.

It's too bad there are no TV reporters in this country.
