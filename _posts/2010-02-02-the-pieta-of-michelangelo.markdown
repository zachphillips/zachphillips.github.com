In a corner of St. Peter's is a statue behind bullet-proof glass and a little set back. There aren't too many people crowded around it, either. At least there weren't the day I was there. The statue is by Michelangelo, and it's called "The Rome Pietá." The fact that the word "Rome" has to be thrown in there is nonsense, because I just don't think anyone should care about any other Pietá after this one, especially not any of Michelangelo's other Pietás.

This statue is... And you can look at pictures of it, which I don't think even give a smidgeon of an idea... it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I don't know why! I don't know what that means! "The most beautiful thing I've ever seen..." Yuck! What the hell does that mean? I don't even like the sound of that, yet I'm compelled to say it. I can't help it. This was all I could think as I stood there staring at it for two hours, tempted (and able, if I so pleased) to cry. To actually cry! What in hell is wrong with me?! It's a piece of stone, for Christ's sake... It made me feel embarrassed and vulnerable about the feelings I was having for it. When a friend tried to talk to me while I was looking at it, I didn't know what to say. I was at a loss for words. I wanted to be cool, I wanted to maintain the status quo, but the emotions were so great that the whole situation was made awkward.

When I finally left, I walked by a girl in my class, who was with her mother (her parents had come to visit her in Rome). She asked "So what do you think?" This is what I said, and I don't embellish. "I think it dwarfs this whole building..." and then I added, or I should say, the words came out of my mouth "...and maybe this whole town," and tears started to form in my eyes as I quickly walked away.

What a cheeseball!!! Who says something like that and walks off weeping?! I'm trying to protect my manhood here, but in all honesty, this thing that Michelangelo carved when he was twenty-three years old moved me, touched me, shook me, jarred me so deeply that I really lost control of myself, and I mean that. I felt so disoriented by it that simple tasks like walking became clumsy and surreal. Now I know what all the hype is about.

If you go to Rome, do not miss it.
