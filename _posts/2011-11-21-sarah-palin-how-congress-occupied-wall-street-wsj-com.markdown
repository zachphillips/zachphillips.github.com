Holy smokes! Sarah Palin wrote something smart!

> This call for real reform must transcend political parties. The grass-roots movements of the right and the left should embrace this. The tea party's mission has always been opposition to waste and crony capitalism, and the Occupy protesters must realize that Washington politicians have been "Occupying Wall Street" long before anyone pitched a tent in Zuccotti Park.

Either Sarah Palin really means this, or she's the smartest politician in America today. Which I realize isn't saying much, but it's something.
