title: Freedom from iPhone Interruptions
---

>Do you ever want to put your iPhone in airplane mode to block everyone out? But you can't, because your husband or your grandmother might need to get through? If you just want to skip over my ramblings and get to the [solution][silence], feel free.

Sometimes, the simplest things elude us.

I was listening to the [Mac Power Users][1] podcast on [Workflows with Merlin Mann][2] and just when the part of me that likes to overthink things like task management and productivity was about to climax, it got a swift kick to the groin.

Merlin mentioned that he doesn't check email but a couple times a day, and the rest of the time, it's off.

Being someone who established a crazy, hacked workaround to use MobileMe mail to push my Google apps mail and regular Gmail accounts to my iPhone, so that if you send me an email, I will get it *that second*, this made me upset (figuring out that workaround took me a while!). After thinking about it for 8 or 11 seconds, though, I had to admit he was right.

If I'm available to respond to email at any time of the day, then am I really a writer, a web developer, or a filmmaker? No. I'm first and foremost someone who checks email, and responds to email.

Being the [Inbox Zero][zero] extraordinaire that I am, never comfortable unless all my emails have been replied to and my inbox is mindlikewater empty, my case, I had to concede, was even more pathetic than most.

I was an email monkey (not to be confused with a [MailChimp][chimp]) and I had been for some time.

So, naturally, I dismantled my-email-gets-to-me-way-faster-than-yours-does, turned off all notifications, switched back to the Gmail web interface (which I have always loved), banished Mail.app to the murky depths next to Acrobat, and hid iPhone Mail in a generic folder *on page 3*.

But what about phone calls? People can still call at any time of the day, and take my attention away from whatever I might be looking at.

"Turn off your phone," you might say. But there is a problem with this: I have a *girlfriend* (and some family, coworkers, but mostly a girlfriend), and she needs me sometimes, and I want to be available to her.

So how do you let certain contacts get through and send others to voicemail without having to pick up the phone, acknowledge someone is calling, and ignore them (This really seems to be almost as much of an interuption as actually answering)?

Seems like there should be a simple solution to this, but surprisingly, there isn't. There is no native way to group and filter contacts, and when you set the phone to silent, it's silent for everyone. 

With [Google Voice][gvoice] (assuming you switched to using only your Google Voice number), you could do it easily, but that comes with a lot of other weird janky issues and most people still want to use their native SIM telephone number. I certainly do. 

If you have a second line, you could set your iPhone to forward calls to your Google Voice number, and then set your settings to allow your inner circle contacts to ring that second line (You can't have it re-ring your iPhone, because that just sets up an infinity loop of forwarding). 

But I don't have a second phone. 

You could have those special people contact you through Skype or Gchat, but that just opens up a whole other can of worms, and if my girlfriend wants to call me, she might not have access to one of those services.

If you can't tell, I gave this some thought.

After retiring to bed, frustrated and feeling that I'd wasted a lot of time, it came to me: **Simplest. Solution. Ever.**

[Here it is][silence]. A ringtone. A silent ringtone.

Set it to your default ringtone and remember to turn off vibrate when in ringing mode. You can leave your silent setting vibrating or however you wish.

Now, only people you have set custom ringtones for will ring, and you can work in peace, and check your voicemails later, when you are on a break (I recommend [Google Voice][gvoice] for your voicemail, now that the [native app][itunes] is ready.

So just [download the ringtone][silence] I've made for you, double-click it, sync your iPhone, and don't let 'em interupt your important work!
