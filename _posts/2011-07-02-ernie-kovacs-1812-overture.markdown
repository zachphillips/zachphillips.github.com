I was eating eggs with my girlfriend  and listening to NPR this morning and there was a feature story on Ernie Kovacs and how much he influenced the David Lettermans and (especially) Conan O'Briens of today.

I grew up watching an Ernie Kovacs VHS boxed set with *both* of my grandfathers. Like a lot of comedy that is from another temporal or cultural context, it can take some effort to open your mind to a different kind of humor than you are used to. The most certain way to *get* a joke is to experience it with someone who is (literally) slapping their knee. I was very lucky to have my grandfathers for that.

It's interesting how much of Conan's work was clearly influenced by Kovacs. I never made that connection, being a longtime fan of both of them.

If you don't think the timpani monkeys are the funniest thing you've seen all day, go watch it with my grandfather. It's hilarious. I promise.
